# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Java program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms and displays the nth Fibonacci number.

## Features
- Takes user input to determine the number of terms in the sequence.
- Prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.
- Displays the nth Fibonacci number.

## Technologies Used
- Java

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of terms.
2. It initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
3. The program then calculates the next numbers in the sequence using the formula:
   ```
   next = a + b;
   ```
4. It prints the sequence up to the nth term and also displays the final Fibonacci number in the sequence.

## Example Usage
```
Enter the number of terms: 8
Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
The 8th Fibonacci number is: 13
```

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java file using:
   ```sh
   javac Fibonacci.java
   ```
2. Run the compiled file:
   ```sh
   java Fibonacci
   ```

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- A terminal or command prompt to run the program.
